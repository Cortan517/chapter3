# Learning Dart Basics
In this chapter, I learned the basics of Dart, the programming language used with Flutter. I discovered why Dart is an ideal choice for building fast and efficient apps, particularly with its focus on performance and developer productivity. I learned how to comment code for clarity and how to use the top-level main() function to run a Dart application. The chapter introduced me to various data types, including numbers, strings, Booleans, lists, maps, and runes, and how to reference them in my code. I explored common flow control statements like if, for, while, and the ternary operator, as well as how to use switch and case for decision-making. Additionally, I learned how to write functions to group reusable logic, use the import statement to include external packages and libraries, and create my own classes to organize code. The chapter also covered asynchronous programming, showing me how to write non-blocking code to keep the user interface responsive. These Dart fundamentals laid the groundwork for writing more complex and efficient code in Flutter apps.
